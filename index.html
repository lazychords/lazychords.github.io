    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    
LazyChords is a project created by Master 1 students in computer science at ENS de Lyon.<br /> 
This project aims at providing a tool to allow musicians to find suitable accompaniments for their melodies. Currently, we focus on providing a good Chord Progression that fits the melody, and that sounds as well as possible.

This can be useful independently of the user's musical skills :
<ul><li>For beginners, it allows a quick generation of an a ready-to-play accompaniement without any theoretical background about composition.</li>
<li>For advanced musicians, the software can be a source of interesting/unusual ideas, and speed up the overall composition process by providing a strong basis to start with.</li>
    </ul>
